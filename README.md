## hihi draw on my strawpage and i (might) doodle back if u send urs. please send asks on neospring
dear ponytowners if ur gonna int with me please SEND WHISPERS instead of directly talking in front of my face,, im very very scared of people + i dont know when its directed at me + i might be offtab or zoning out

other konan skins make me uncomfortable but please dont take it to heart i dont hate you im just terrified of myself and/or others mischaracterizing my faves

any nart skins can sit w me tho but it might get uncomfortable for either of us since i rarely speak up unless ur my brothers or my friends

on discord & ponytown sometimes i revert to talking in single emoji sentences or gifs 

check my rentry for actual info ask questions on strawpage or neospring
