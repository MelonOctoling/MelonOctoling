Whisper instead of directly interacting with me out of the blue cuz I dissociate or zone out a lot  ! ! Also conversation might get uncomfortable because I go from chatty to silent really fast + i am accidentally mean sometimes

Skins of my fictionkins & fictives scare me im sorry. its not rlly "doubles dni" but it is sortof,, it depends which kin ya know

Btw can we not whisper me for "whimper audios" when I'm cosplaying Aizetsu, you're not funny you're just creepy. Hi hello I'm a MINOR behind the screen not a 200 year old demon!!! 

Also it's just weird even if I was an adult, because you're probably kids...
